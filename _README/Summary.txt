One thing that I would suggest to improve about this assignment: 
Thank you for the opportunity to work on the Cleo Hiring Chart Task. 
I appreciated the clear instructions and sufficient documentation,
which made the task enjoyable and manageable in one evening.
The task was interesting and appropriately challenging.
I especially valued the chance to engage with your existing application
and codebase, providing a realistic insight into your work environment.
This experience was both informative and beneficial for my professional development.
